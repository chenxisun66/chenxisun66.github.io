#### About 

Hi! I am a Postdoc (supervisor: [Prof. Xiaoying Tang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tangxiaoying) and [Prof. Yingjun Zhang](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~yjzhang/)) affiliated with SSE at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn). I am also affiliated with [AIRS](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn).

I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk) in 2020. My PhD adviser was [Prof. Victor O.K. Li](https://vli.eee.hku.hk).

From Jan 2019 to Aug 2019, I was a visiting student at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu) supervised by [Prof. Steven H. Low](https://netlab.caltech.edu). 

I earned my B.Eng. from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk) in 2015, majoring in Electronic and Communication Engineering.

My research lies at the intersection of Data Science, Optimization, and Machine Learning and their applications in smart cities.
